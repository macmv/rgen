This is the block data and its model mapping

# Mod systems
For our purpose, a "mod system" refers to a system of blocks, items, and/or mobs that work symbiotically. An example of this is Moss which is a block that can be grown to create more of itsef and then fused with other blocks to make moss varients of that block. Another example could be a fir tree which adds fir blocks wich can then be crafted into fir planks, doors, fences, and stairs. 

## Basic tree system example
Building a tree
 - log
 - leaves
 - door
 - trapdoor
 - planks

 - slabs*
 - stairs*
 - fence*
 - gate*

## Lime System
adds limestone block
limestone is needed to make concrete powder

## The Moss System

### The incubator
incubator (entity)
-crafted by stone block sides with a middle stack of a _water bucket_ then a _mossblock_ then a _cauldron_ 

- by placing a water bucket in the top block then placing the plant to be incubated; a duplicate is then generated

- the block being incubated can be: moss, vines, brown mushrooms, red mushrooms

- by placing a water bucket and an incubatable item which over time will get you a duplicate of that block

# Features

## Stumps and logs
stumps and logs are standard of most forests in the real world for our purposes, a stump and log are single logs standing upright (stump) followed by a block of air and then two-five blocks of xz axis logs
||  ===  <- an asci example

### how a log generates
stumps and logs can come in 3 standards 
1) a stump and log - 35%
2) just a log - 30%
3) just a stump - 35%

The **chance of mossy**-ness is chosen by percentage ranging from none-0%, low-25%, mid-45%, high-80%\
When a mossy block is placed, there is a 55% chance of block from the **plant blockset** being placed on top and a 10% chance of _mossy_carpet_

- For a stump, just check blocks -1,0 1,0 0,1 0,-1 to make sure they are not ground blocks
  - each side of the stump has a 10% chance of a _polypore_ being on it
- For a log, first, choose a direction and length, then check all edges for ground and check the start and end for ground (this will allow in rare circumstances for logs to hang between two points of land)
  - the start and end of the logs have a 25% chance of a _polypore_ being on it
  - the sides of each log have a 10% chance of a _polypore_ being on it
- For a log and stump, do both checks, then place the stump and log


## Generated snow layers
Snow generates based on **snow grade** rated 0,1,2,3 or low,mid,high,heavy 
each biome and block will have unique levels of snow-grade
Example:
**Snowy Fir Forest**
- Forest ground: high
    - blocks exposed to sky that are [grass, dirt, fir logs, oak logs, ponzel, gravel] will have a high level of snow on them
- Forest leaf cover: mid
    - Blocks exposed to the sky that are leaves [fir leaves] have a mid-level of snow 

# Modpack generation problems
A "modpack generation problem" refers to a structure, plant, mob, ore, etc. that is added by another mod to vanilla Minecraft and must then be generated by RGen to make the modpack work. 

## Pams harvest craft
pams harvest craft is one of the largest food mods in minecraft and adds gardens (basicaly breakbale loot chests of ingredients that are based on specific biomes) and fruit trees (oak trees with large oversized fruit hanging from them). The owner of the mod is really defensive of their work.

### The tree problem
Pams harvestcraft trees don't really fit in the RGen style of the world

### The garden problem
We need to figure out how to make sure that gardens both generate and generate in custom biomes

## Ores
A fair few mods add select ores below is a growing list of ores that will need to be considerd.\
