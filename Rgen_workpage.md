This is the block data and its model mapping

# Mod systems
For our pourpese a "mod system" refers to a system of blocks, items, and/or mobs that work sybioticly. An example of this is Moss which is a block that can be grown to create more of itsef and then fused with other blocks to make moss varients of that block. Another example could be a fir tree which adds fir blocks wich can then be crafted into fir planks, doors, fences, and stairs. 

## Basic tree system example
Building a tree
 - log
 - leaves
 - door
 - trapdoor
 - planks

 - slabs*
 - stairs*
 - fence*
 - gate*


## The Moss System
### Current status
"*" = A) texture B) block/model C) blockstates\
"#" = is a block but may miss features\
"%" = not done\
"[]" = fixes needed\

moss_covered_cobblestone % % % moss covered cobblestone   %\
mossy_cobblestone_rgen * * * mossy cobblestone            #\
mossy_stone * * * mossy stone                             #\
mossy_block * * * moss block                              # done [sound fix, needs item]\
mossy_carpet * * * mossy carpet                           # done [sound fix, needs item]\
mossy_stump * * * mossy stump                             # needs sides and varients \
                                                            [sound fix, needs item]\
mossy_bush * * * mossy bush                               # done [sound fix, needs item]\

### The incubator
incubator (entity)
-craffted by stone block sides with a middle stack of water bucket then mossblock then coldron 

- by placing a water bucket in the top block then place the plant to be incubated a duplicate is then generated

- the block being incubated can be: moss, vines, brown mushrooms, red mushrooms

- by placing a water bucket and an inubatable item which over time will get you a duplicate of that block
## Palm Trees
palm_log 
palm_leaves 

## Generated snow layers
Snow generates based on **snow grade** rated 0,1,2,3 or low,mid,high,heavy 
each biome and block will have unique levels of snow grade
Example:
**Snowy Fir Forest**
- Forest ground: high
    - blocks exposed to sky that are [grass, dirt, fir logs, oak logs, ponzel, gravel] will have a high level of snow on them
- Forest leaf cover: mid
    - Blocks exposed to the sky that are leaves [fir leaves] have a mid level of snow 

# Modpack generation problems
A "modpack generation problem" refers to a structure, plant, mob, ore, ect. that is added by another mod to vanilla minecraft and must then be generated by RGen to make the modpack work. 

## Pams harvestcraft
pams harvest craft is one of the largest food mods in minecraft and adds gardens (basicaly breakbale loot chests of ingredients that are based on specific biomes) and fruit trees (oak trees with large oversized fruit hanging from them). The owner of the mod is really defensive of their work.

### The tree problem
Pams harvestcraft trees don't really fit in the RGen style of world

### The garden problem
We need to figure out how to make sure that gardens both generate and generate in custom biomes

## Ores
A fair few mods add select ores below is a growing list of ores that will need to be considerd.
